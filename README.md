# Live Compositor deployment examples

This repo includes example configurations that show how you can deploy Live Compositor to the production environment. 

Examples here aim to be complete configurations that can be deployed on their own. Some elements are unrelated to the compositor itself and are just there to create a complete example. The below guides are not intended to show how to use AWS/Terraform. They are here to showcase how you might fit compositor in your existing infrastructure.

## AWS EC2 with Terraform
